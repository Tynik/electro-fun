With a focus on small size and high efficiency, they are ideal for applications demanding isolated voltage outputs from the input power source.</p><h4>Overload Protection</h4><p>Under normal operating conditions, the output circuit of this product does not provide overload protection. Prolonged overload conditions will trigger over-temperature protection, leading to output shutdown.</p><h4>Output Short-Circuit Protection</h4><p>The product provides sustainable short-circuit protection with automatic recovery.</p><h4>Caution Regarding External Capacitors</h4><p>The capacitance value of externally connected capacitors should not be too large, as it may lead to over-current or poor startup performance during module initialization.</p>",
      "warningContent": "<p>It is advisable to avoid operating the module under no-load conditions. If the actual power consumption of the load is less than 10% of the module's rated output power, or if there is a no-load condition, it is recommended to externally connect a dummy load (resistor) at the output. The value of the dummy load (resistor) can be calculated as 5-10% of the module's rated power, with the resistance value equal to R = Uout / (W * 10%).</p><p>So, you would need a resistor with a value of approximately 112.5 ohms. Since standard resistor values come in discrete steps, you would typically choose the nearest standard resistor value, such as 110 ohms or 120 ohms, depending on availability.</p><p>If the product operates below the minimum required load, the performance of the product may not meet all the performance indicators specified in the datasheet.</p>",
