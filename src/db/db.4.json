With a focus on small size and high efficiency, they are ideal for applications demanding isolated voltage outputs from the input power source.</p><h4>Overload Protection</h4><p>Under normal operating conditions, the output circuit of this product does not provide overload protection. Prolonged overload conditions will trigger over-temperature protection, leading to output shutdown.</p><h4>Output Short-Circuit Protection</h4><p>The product provides sustainable short-circuit protection with automatic recovery.</p><h4>Caution Regarding External Capacitors</h4><p>The capacitance value of externally connected capacitors should not be too large, as it may lead to over-current or poor startup performance during module initialization.</p>",

If the actual power consumption of the load is less than 10% of the module's rated output power, or if there is a no-load condition, it is recommended to externally connect a dummy load (resistor) at the output. The value of the dummy load (resistor) can be calculated as 5-10% of the module's rated power, with the resistance value equal to R = Uout / (W * 10%).</p><p>So, you would need a resistor with a value of approximately 112.5 ohms. Since standard resistor values come in discrete steps, you would typically choose the nearest standard resistor value, such as 110 ohms or 120 ohms, depending on availability.</p><p>If the product operates below the minimum required load, the performance of the product may not meet all the performance indicators specified in the datasheet.</p>",

With its ability to store energy, filter out noise, and regulate voltage levels, the CD54 is indispensable for achieving optimal performance in your circuits.</p><p><strong>Filtering and Smoothing:</strong> Inductors are commonly used in conjunction with capacitors to form low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filters. These filters remove unwanted frequencies or noise from signals, ensuring a smoother and cleaner output.</p><p><strong>Energy Storage:</strong> Inductors store energy in the form of a magnetic field when current flows through them. This stored energy can be released when the current decreases, acting as a source of energy for the circuit and smoothing out voltage fluctuations.</p><p><strong>DC-DC Conversion:</strong> Inductors play a crucial role in DC-DC converters by storing and transferring energy efficiently. They help regulate voltage levels, step up or step down voltage, and improve power conversion efficiency.</p><p><strong>Impedance Matching:</strong> Inductors are used in impedance matching circuits to ensure maximum power transfer between components, especially in RF circuits and antenna systems.</p><p><strong>Magnetic Coupling:</strong> Inductors can be used in transformers to transfer energy from one circuit to another while maintaining electrical isolation.
